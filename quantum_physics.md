# Quantum Physics

We humans are storytellers. It helps us to simplify our understanding of the world. But, it also limits our perception to well-established concepts that may be an obstacle for further progress. Let's take a look at quantum physics. :)

## Gravity is the spontaneous synchronization of entropy

Let's assume that all quantum particles have an electro-magnetic oscillation that could be represented by a clock or metronom.
This oscillation is spread by a wave in all directions.

Particles move due to heat, collisions, interactions, radiation and etc. in a choatic way.
Because particles move, the oscillations (clocks) between the particles will get out of sync due to special relativity.

This leads to an interference of the oscillation waves between all particles, and in effect all particles will experience [spontaneos synchronization](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T58lGKREubo).
A very small force will be applied to all particles, accumulating into a general force that pulls all mass.
