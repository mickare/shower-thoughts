# Shower Thoughts

Prepare a tin foil hat.
This is a small Github page with a collection of some shower thoughts about random things.
I'm not a physicist, nor mathematician. Just a random dude on the Internet.
Please expect a lot of wrong or crazy stuff here and have fun. :D

# Quantum Physics

We humans are storytellers. It helps us to simplify our understanding of the world. But, it also limits our perception to well-established concepts that may be an obstacle for further progress. Let's try new perspectives at quantum physics.

## Gravity is the spontaneous synchronization of entropy

**What if** all quantum particles have an electro-magnetic oscillation (like a clock).
This oscillation is spread by a very small electro-magnetic wave in all directions, so small that it is free of interactions due to a planck constant threshold.

Particles move due to heat, collisions, interactions, radiation, etc. in a choatic way.
Because particles move, the oscillations (clocks) between the particles will get out of sync due to special relativity.

This leads to an interference of the oscillation waves between all particles, and in effect all particles will experience [spontaneos synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_of_chaos).
A very small force will be applied to all particles, accumulating into a general force that pulls all mass - gravity.


### Thoughts

- What about black holes then? Is a black hole then the collapse of entropy, in a way, that the oscillations are resonating larger than the planck constant threshold, leading to direct interference?
- Was the big bang a resonance disaster?
- Will material at absolute zero still experience gravity? Probably yes, because of the external noise?
